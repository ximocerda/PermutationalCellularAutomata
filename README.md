This repository provides simulation tools and examples accompanying the research article *Permutational Cellular Automata: From Bitwise Reversibility to Quantum Dynamics*. The work introduces a new class of Reversible Cellular Automata (PeCA), where state updates are defined as permutations and naturally extend to unitary quantum evolutions.

## 🔬 About the Project

Permutational Cellular Automata (PeCA) provide a novel modeling framework combining:

- **Bitwise reversibility** through permutation-based update rules  
- **Explicit numbering schemes** (factoradic, Lehmer code) for efficient encoding  
- **A bridge to quantum computing**, with unitary evolutions naturally arising from classical reversible structures

We explore their behavior under different rules, configurations, and dimensions, including transitions from trivial to complex dynamics (Wolfram Classes I–IV).
