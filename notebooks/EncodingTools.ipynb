Permutational Cellular Automata (PeCA) Playground
Author: Joaquín Cerdá-Boluda
Based on: PeCA model as introduced in the paper " Permutational Cellular Automata: From Bitwise Reversibility to Quantum Dynamics "

Introduction
This Colab notebook provides an interactive environment to experiment with the Permutational Cellular Automata (PeCA) model. PeCA is a discrete computational model where local update rules are based on permutations of bit segments, and interactions between cells are specified via configurable connectivities.

The notebook is divided into the following parts:

Combinatorial Encoding Tools: Conversion functions between natural numbers, factoradic numbers, and permutations.
PeCA Architecture: Definition of the cell structure, state evolution, and lattice configuration.
Visualization: Tools to simulate and display PeCA behavior for different rules and initial conditions.
Advanced Use (Optional): Pathways to quantum extensions of the model.
Let’s start by implementing the foundational combinatorial machinery.
